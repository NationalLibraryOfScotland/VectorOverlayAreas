VectorOverlayAreas
==================

This <a href="http://geo.nls.uk/maps/dev/digitalideas/vector_overlay_areas.html">demonstration application</a> using <a href="http://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a> 3.5 illustrates a vector overlay of areas with information on mouse hover. It uses a GEOJSON file of area polygons, tracing the boundaries of property ownership in Edinburgh in 1817, from <a href="http://maps.nls.uk/joins/416.html">Robert Kirkwood's 'This plan of the City of Edinburgh and its environs' (1817)</a>. It is based on the OpenLayers <a href="http://openlayers.org/en/v3.5.0/examples/vector-layer.html">Vector Layer example</a>. A choice of different dates of historic maps of Edinburgh as base layers can be selected - these are taken partly from the <a href="http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/">National Library of Scotland georeferenced maps</a>.
